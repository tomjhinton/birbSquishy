# birbSquishy

- The speed with which this week fell apart was real impressive.
- Initally I was like I know how I'd do that. 
- I did not know how to do that.

***

- Main issue is directional squishiness.
- Think that's the technical term.
- This only squishes along the z axis.
- Behind squishes are now pinch squishes. 
- If anyone want's to explain how to do it like you would to a child.
- Like one of the dumb childs. 
- I did some muttering about dot products and then ran out of time.

*** 

- In theory the middle one is a bird.
- I don't know types of bird.
- Basically wanted to see if I could load a gltf in to my squishy function.

***

- Random point cloud to distract from everything else.
